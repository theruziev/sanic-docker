# Sanic Dockerfile

This repository is for the Sanic Docker image.

## What does this image do?

It preinstalls the latest [**Sanic LTS**](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/18.12.0/) version on top of a **Python 3.7**. The container runs Alpine Linux.

## How do I use this?

Setup your own Dockerfile

    FROM sanicframework/sanic:LTS

    RUN mkdir /srv
    COPY . /srv

    EXPOSE 8888

    ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/srv/my-sanic-server.py"]

Build it

    docker build -t my-sanic-server .

Run it as you would any other container

    docker run my-sanic-server
